Data Story :

Out of the completed orders, Standard mode of delivery is the most preferred mode of delivery. It may be due to the less cost of delivery associated with it. So, in order to boost other forms of delivery, we may need to provide some forms of discount to other forms of delivery other than Standard. We may have to partner with an appropriate delivery partner for that purpose.       

There is a few percentage of people, who are not buying accessories. We should encourage them by providing targeted ads and offers.There is also a few percentage of people who cancel their orders. We have to find the reason behind that as reasons are many like they may find a better deal elsewhere or the delivery may be taking a longer time or they may find that the product is faulty and might return.
